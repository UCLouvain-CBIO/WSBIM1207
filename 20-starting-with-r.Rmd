# Starting with R  {#sec:startr}


**Learning Objectives**

- Describe the purpose of the RStudio Script, Console, Environment, and Plots
  panes.

- Organize files and directories for a set of analyses as an R
  project, and understand the purpose of the working directory.

- Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more
  information on R functions.

- Demonstrate how to provide sufficient information for
  troubleshooting with the R user community.


## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is used to refer to both the
*programming language*, the *environment for statistical computing*
and *the software* that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is currently a very popular way to not
only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R
software[^plainr]. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and
therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

[^plainr]: As opposed to using R directly from the command line
    console. There exist other software that interface and integrate
    with R, but RStudio is particularly well suited for beginners and
    while providing numerous very advanced features.

The [RStudio IDE Cheat
Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf)
provides much more information that will be covered here, but can be
useful to learn keyboard shortcuts and discover new features.

## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing {-}

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with
R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a
succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of
written commands, and that's a good thing! So, if you want to redo
your analysis because you collected more data, you don't have to
remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your
results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear,
and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give
you feedback and spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what
you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the
methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility {-}

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can
obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same
analysis.

R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your
code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the
figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated
automatically.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses
to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these
requirements.

We will learn more about reproducibility and reproducible research in
chapter \@ref(sec:rr).

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible {-}

With 10000+ packages[^whatarepkgs] that can be installed to extend its
capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine
statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit
the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance,
R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population
genetics, and a lot more.

[^whatarepkgs]: i.e. add-ons that confer R with new functionality,
    such as bioinformatics data analysis - see chapter
    \@ref(sec:bioinfo)

```{r, fig.cap = "Exponential increase of the number of packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. From the R Journal, Volume 10/2, December 2018.", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/cran.png")
```

### R works on data of all shapes and sizes {-}

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your
dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it
won't make much difference to you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures
and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical
factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats,
on your computer or on the web.


### R produces high-quality graphics {-}

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust
any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from
your data.


### R has a large and welcoming community {-}

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you
through mailing lists and websites such as [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or on the [RStudio
community](https://community.rstudio.com/). These broad user community
extends to specialised areas such as bioinformatics.


### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform {-}

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or
someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.

## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/),
which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with
R.

The RStudio IDE open-source product is free under the [Affero General
Public License (AGPL) v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).
The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and
priority email support from RStudio, Inc.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our
computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize
the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things
(e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that
we will not cover during the workshop.


```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, Console.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/rstudio-screenshot.png")
```

RStudio is divided into 4 "Panes":

- the **Source** for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the
  default layout)
- your **Environment/History** (top-right),
- your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right), and
- the R **Console** (bottom-left).

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see
menu, `Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout`).

One of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you
need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with
many shortcuts, **autocompletion**, and **highlighting** for the major
file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing
easier and less error-prone.

## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working
directory**. All of the scripts within this folder can then use
**relative paths** to files that indicate where inside the project a
file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a
file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot
easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts
will still work.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers
its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves
custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a
break. Go through the steps for creating an "R Project" for this
tutorial below.

1. Start RStudio.
2. Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`. Choose `New directory`, then
  `New project`.
3. Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory"), and choose a
   convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
   for this session (or whole course) (e.g., `wsbim1207`).
4. Click on `Create project`.
5. (Optional) Set Preferences to 'Never' save workspace in RStudio.

RStudio's default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to
.RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets.
To turn that off, go to Tools --> 'Global Options' and select the 'Never' option
for 'Save workspace to .RData' on exit.'

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="Set 'Save workspace to .RData on exit' to 'Never'", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/rstudio-preferences.png")
```

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**.

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate
   datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For
   the sake of transparency and
   [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you should
   *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
   your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with
   scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data
   from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could
   have files `data/raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt` and `...plot2.txt` kept
   separate from a `data/processed/tree.survey.csv` file generated by
   the `scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R` script.
 - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts,
   and other text.
 - **`scripts/`** (or `src`) This would be the location to keep your R
   scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a
   separate folder for your functions (more on that later).

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on
your project needs, but these should form the backbone of your working
directory.


```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="Example of a working directory structure.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/working-directory-structure.png")
```

For this course, we will need a `data/` folder to store our raw data,
and we will use `data_output/` for when we learn how to export data as
CSV files, and `fig_output/` folder for the figures that we will save.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory
(e.g., `~/wsbim1207/data`). (Alternatively, type `dir.create("data")` at
your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a `data_output/` and a
`fig_output` folders.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory
because we are only going to use one file and it will make things
easier.

Your working directory should now look like this:

```{r, results='markup',fig.cap="How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/r-starting-how-it-should-look-like.png")
```

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the
place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you
write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to
the root of your working directory and only need files within this
structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working
directory is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use
`getwd()`. If for some reason your working directory is not what it
should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in
the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking
on the blue gear icon `More`, and select `Set As Working Directory`.
Alternatively you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to
reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include
this line because it will fail on someone else's computer.

**Example**

The shema below represents the working directory `wsbim1207` with the
`data` and `fig_output` sub-directories, and 2 files in the latter:

```
wsbim1207/data/
         /fig_output/fig1.pdf
         /fig_output/fig2.png
```

If we were in the working directory, we could refer to the `fig1.pdf`
file using the relative path `wsbim1207/fig_output/fig1.pdf` or the
absolute path `/home/user/wsbim1207/fig_output/fig1.pdf`.

If we were in the `data` directory, we would use the relative path
`../fig_output/fig1.pdf` or the same absolute path
`/home/user/wsbim1207/fig_output/fig1.pdf`.

## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the
computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those
instructions. We write, or *code*, instructions in R because it is a
common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call
the instructions *commands* and we tell the computer to follow the
instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the
**console** or by using **scripts** (plain text files that contain
your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is
the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and
executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results
will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type
commands directly into the console and press `Enter` to execute those
commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better
to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the
script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and
anyone (including our future selves!)  can easily replicate the
results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor
by using the `Ctrl` + `Enter` shortcut (on Macs, `Cmd` + `Return` will
work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated
by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text
will be sent to the console and executed when you press `Ctrl` +
`Enter`. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this [RStudio
cheatsheet about the RStudio
IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a
variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a
record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute
them directly in the console.  RStudio provides the `Ctrl` + `1` and
`Ctrl` + `2` shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the
console panes.

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If
it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script
editor using `Ctrl` + `Enter`), R will try to execute it, and when
ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to
wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't
complete yet, the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you
haven't finished entering a complete command. This is because you have
not 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don't have the same
number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of
opening and closing quotation marks.  When this happens, and you
thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console
window and press `Esc`; this will cancel the incomplete command and
return you to the `>` prompt.


## How to learn more during and after the course?

The material we cover during this course will give you an initial
taste of how you can use R to analyse data for your own
research. However, you will need to learn more to do advanced
operations such as cleaning your dataset, using statistical methods,
or creating beautiful graphics[^inthiscoure]. The best way to become
proficient and efficient at R, as with any other tool, is to use it to
address your actual research questions. As a beginner, it can feel
daunting to have to write a script from scratch, and given that many
people make their code available online, modifying existing code to
suit your purpose might make it easier for you to get started.

[^inthiscoure]: We will introduce most of these (except statistics)
    here, but will only manage to scratch the surface of the wealth of
    what is possible to do with R.

```{r kitten, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='400px', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/kitten-try-things.jpg")
```

## Seeking help

### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions {-}

```{r rstudiohelp, fig.cap="RStudio help interface.", results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/rstudiohelp.png")
```

One of the fastest ways to get help, is to use the RStudio help
interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand
panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word
"Mean", RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you
might be interested in. The description is then shown in the display
window.

### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it {-}

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you
can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?barplot
```

If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
args(lm)
```

### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one... {-}

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the
`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.
However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a
match to your search request

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
??kruskal
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use
the [rdocumentation.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches
through the help files across all packages available.

Finally, a generic Google or internet search "R \<task\>" will often either send
you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone
else has already asked your question.

### I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand {-}

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds"). If the message is very generic, you
might also include the name of the function or package you're using in your
query.

However, you should check Stack Overflow. Search using the `[r]` tag. Most
questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
words in the search to find the
answers:

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

The [Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) can
also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good
place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.

The [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) is dense and technical
but it is full of useful information.

### Asking for help {-}

The key to receiving help from someone is for them to rapidly grasp
your problem. You should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where
the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a
package is not the same thing as a library. Most people will
understand what you meant, but others have really strong feelings
about the difference in meaning. The key point is that it can make
things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as precise as
possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple *reproducible
example*. If you can reproduce the problem using a very small data
frame instead of your 50000 rows and 10000 columns one, provide the
small one with the description of your problem. When appropriate, try
to generalize what you are doing so even people who are not in your
field can understand the question. For instance instead of using a
subset of your real dataset, create a small (3 columns, 5 rows)
generic one. For more information on how to write a reproducible
example see [this article by Hadley
Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html).

To share an object with someone else, if it's relatively small, you
can use the function `dput()`. It will output R code that can be used
to recreate the exact same object as the one in memory:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
## iris is an example data frame that comes with R and head() is a
## function that returns the first part of the data frame
dput(head(iris))
```

If the object is larger, provide either the raw file (i.e., your CSV
file) with your script up to the point of the error (and after
removing everything that is not relevant to your
issue). Alternatively, in particular if your question is not related
to a data frame, you can save any R object to a file[^export]:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
saveRDS(iris, file="/tmp/iris.rds")
```

[^export]: See section \@ref(sec:exportandsave) for a better
    introduction about exporting and saving data.

The content of this file is however not human readable and cannot be
posted directly on Stack Overflow. Instead, it can be sent to someone
by email who can read it with the `readRDS()` command (here it is
assumed that the downloaded file is in a `Downloads` folder in the
user's home directory):

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
some_data <- readRDS(file="~/Downloads/iris.rds")
```

Last, but certainly not least, **always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**
as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

### Where to ask for help? {-}

* The person sitting next to you during the course. Don't hesitate to
  talk to your neighbour during the workshop, compare your answers,
  and ask for help.
* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience
  than you, they might be able and willing to help you.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if
  your question hasn't been answered before and is well crafted,
  chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to
  follow their guidelines on [how to ask a good
  question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
* The [R-help mailing
  list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help): it is read by a
  lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people
  post to it, but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always
  very welcoming to new users. If your question is valid, you are
  likely to get an answer very fast but don't expect that it will come
  with smiley faces. Also, here more than anywhere else, be sure to
  use correct vocabulary (otherwise you might get an answer pointing
  to the misuse of your words rather than answering your
  question). You will also have more success if your question is about
  a base function rather than a specific package.
* If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a
  mailing list for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file
  of the package that can be accessed using
  `packageDescription("name-of-package")`. You may also want to try to
  email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the
  code repository (e.g., GitHub).
* There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS,
  phylogenetics, etc...), the complete list is
  [here](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).

## R packages

### Loading packages

As we have seen above, R packages play a fundamental role in R. The
make use of a package's functionality, assuming it is installed, we
first need to load it to be able to use it. This is done with the
`library()` function. Below, we load `ggplot2`.

```{r loadp, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```

### Installing packages

The default package repository is The *Comprehensive R Archive
Network* (CRAN), and any package that is available on CRAN can be
installed with the `install.packages()` function. Below, for example,
we install the `dplyr` package that we will learn about late.

```{r craninstall, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

This command will install the `dplyr` package as well as all its
dependencies, i.e. all the packages that it relies on to function.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a general-pupose online software
project repository and is well suited for R package development. To
install a package from Gtihub, one can use the `install_github()`
function from the `devtools` package. Below we first install the
latter from CRAN (as show above), then we install `rWSBIM1207`
directly from the user `UCLouvain-CBIO` github repository.

```{r ghinstall, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM1207")
```

In section \@ref(sec:bioconductor), we will see how to install
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org), a project dedicated to
bioinformatics and omics packages.

## Introduction to R

**Learning Objectives**

- Define the following terms as they relate to R: object, assign, call, function, arguments, options.
- Assign values to objects in R.
- Learn how to _name_ objects
- Use comments to inform script.
- Solve simple arithmetic operations in R.
- Call functions and use arguments to change their default options.
- Inspect the content of vectors and manipulate their content.
- Subset and extract values from vectors.
- Analyze vectors with missing data.

### Creating objects in R

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Creating objects in R
```

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to
_objects_. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to
objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is
`3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.  For historical
reasons, you can also use `=` for assignments, but not in every
context. Because of the
[slight](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html)
[differences](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Is-there-any-difference-between-and-tp878594p878598.html)
in syntax, it is good practice to always use `<-` for assignments.

In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd>
at the same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) will write ` <- ` in a
single keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> +
<kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Option</kbd> at the same time as the
<kbd>-</kbd> key) does the same in a Mac.

### Naming variables

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too
long. They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2`
is). R is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from
`Weight_kg`). There are some names that cannot be used because they
are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`,
`for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to
not use other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`,
`weights`). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already
in use. It's also best to avoid dots (`.`) within an object name as in
`my.dataset`. There are many functions in R with dots in their names
for historical reasons, but because dots have a special meaning in R
(for methods) and other programming languages, it's best to avoid
them. It is also recommended to use nouns for object names, and verbs
for function names. It's important to be consistent in the styling of
your code (where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.). Using a
consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your
future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides
are [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), [Jean
Fan's](http://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the
[tidyverse's](http://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse's is very
comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the
[**`lintr`**](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package to
automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.

> **Objects vs. variables**
>
> What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
> programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
> have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words
> are used synonymously. For more information see:
> https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects


When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You
can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the
object name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r, purl=FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
other objects  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
object, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`?
126.5 or 220?

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

### Comments

The comment character in R is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a
script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes, and
explanations in your scripts.

RStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after
selecting the lines you want to comment, press at the same time on
your keyboard <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If
you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any
location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then
press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r, purl=FALSE}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
```
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

### Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands
including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
usually gets one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
b <- sqrt(a)
```

Here, the value of `a` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `b`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to
use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value
of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)` or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
args(round)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?round
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
type `digits=2` or however many we want.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.


### Vectors and data types

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Vectors and data types
```

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be
either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using
the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign
it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R
will assume there are objects called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects
don't exist in R's memory, there will be an error message.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.
The function `class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its
elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex
objects:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:
```{r, purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`, add the
value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
`weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving
the result back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a
dataset.  As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are
collecting or calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear
vector of a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main **atomic
vector** types that R uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"` (or
`"double"`). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects
are built from. The other 4 **atomic vector** types are:

* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R
  that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary
  parts (e.g., `1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function
and inputting your vector as the argument.

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other
important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames
(`data.frame`), factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).


`r msmbstyle::question(text = "We've seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?")`

`r msmbstyle::solution(text = "R implicitly converts them to all be the same type")`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
check the data type of your objects):

```{r, eval=TRUE}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
class(num_char)
class(num_logical)
class(char_logical)
class(tricky)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question(text = "Why do you think it happens?")`

`r msmbstyle::solution(text = "Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a *common denominator* that doesn't lose any information.")`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in
the following example:


```{r, eval=TRUE}
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion
happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the `TRUE`
in `num_logical` gets converted into a `1` before it gets converted
into `"1"` in `combined_logical`.

```{r}
combined_logical
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question(text = " In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?")`

`r msmbstyle::solution(text = "logical &#8594; numeric &#8594; character &#8592; logical")`



```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## We’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric, integer, and
## logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single
## vector?

## What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
## check the data type of your object)
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")

num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)

char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)

tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")

## Why do you think it happens?

## You've probably noticed that objects of different types get
## converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we call
## converting objects from one class into another class
## _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
## whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can
## you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data
## types are coerced?
```

### Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB,
Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that's what human beings
typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl,
and Python) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.

Finally, it is also possible to get all the elements of a vector
except some specified elements using negative indices:

```{r}
animals ## all animals
animals[-1] ## all but the first one
animals[-c(1, 3)] ## all but 1st/3rd ones
animals[c(-1, -3)] ## all but 1st/3rd ones
```

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
## will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet
## the condition
weight_g > 50
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

Here, `<` stands for "less than", `>` for "greater than", `>=` for "greater than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r}
"four" > "five"
```

When using ">" or "<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order.
Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### Names

It is possible to name each element of a vector. The code chunk below
show a initial vector without any names, how names are set, and
retrieved.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 5, 3, 5, 10)
names(x) ## no names
names(x) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
names(x) ## now we have names
```

When a vector has names, it is possible to access elements by their
name, in addition to their index.

```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
x[c("A", "C")]
```

### Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data
(which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented
in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm=TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring
the missing values.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
## The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"`
## (or `"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
## The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"`
## (or `"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector with the NAs removed.
```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
```
2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]
## or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
```

```{r}
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## Generating vectors {#sec:genvec}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

### Constructors {-}

There exists some functions to generate vectors of different type. To
generate a vector of numerics, one can use the `numerics()`
constructor, providing the length of the output vector as
parameter. The values will be initialised with 0.

```{r}
numeric(3)
numeric(10)
```

Note that if we ask for a vector of numerics of length 0, we obtain
exactly that:

```{r}
numeric(0)
```

There are similar constructors for characters and logicals, named
`character()` and `logical()` respectively.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
What are the defaults for character and logical vectors?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
character(2) ## the empty charater
logical(2)   ## FALSE
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### Replicate elements {-}

The `rep` function allow to repeat a value a certain number of
times. If we want to initiate a vector of numerics of length 5 with
the value -1, for example, we could do the following:

```{r}
rep(-1, 5)
```

Similarly, to generate a vector populated with missing values, which
is often a good way to start, without setting assumptions on the data
to be collected:

```{r}
rep(NA, 5)
```

`rep` can take vectors of any length as input (above, we used vectors
of length 1) and any type. For example, if we want to repeat the
values 1, 2 and 3 five times, we would do the following:

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2, 3), 5)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
What if we wanted to repeat the values 1, 2 and 3 five times, but
obtain five 1s, five 2s and five 3s in that order? There are two
possibilities - see `?rep` or `?sort` for help.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 5)
sort(rep(c(1, 2, 3), 5))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### Sequence generation {-}

Another very useful function is `seq`, to generate a sequence of
numbers. For example, to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to 20
by steps of 2, one would use:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 2)
```

The default value of `by` is 1 and, given that the generate of a
sequence of one value to another with steps of 1 is frequently used,
there's a shortcut:

```{r}
seq(1, 5, 1)
seq(1, 5) ## default by
1:5
```

To generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20 of final length of 3,
one would use:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 20, length.out = 3)
```

### Random samples and permutations {-}

A last group of useful functions are those that generate random
data. The first one, `sample`, generates a random permutation of
another vector. For example, to draw a random order to 10 students
oral example, I first assign each student a number from 1 to then (for
instance based on the alphabetic order of their name) and then:

```{r}
sample(1:10)
```

Without further arguments, `sample` will return a permutation of all
elements of the vector. If I want a random sample of a certain size, I
would set this value as second argument. Below, I sample 5 random
letters from the alphabet contained in the pre-defined `letters` vector:

```{r}
sample(letters, 5)
```

If I wanted an output larger than the input vector, or being able to
draw some elements multiple times, I would need to set the `replace`
argument to `TRUE`:

```{r}
sample(1:5, 10, replace = TRUE)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

When trying the functions above out, you will have realised that the
samples are indeed random and that one doesn't get the same
permutation twice. To be able to reproduce these random draws, one can
set the random number generation seed manually with `set.seed()`
before drawing the random sample.

- Test this feature with your neighbour. First draw two random
  permutations of `1:10` independently and observe that you get
  different results.

- Now set the seed with, for example, `set.seed(123)` and repeat the
  random draw. Observe that you now get the same random draws.

- Repeat by setting a different seed.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

Different permutations

```{r}
sample(1:10)
sample(1:10)
```

Same permutations with seed 123

```{r}
set.seed(123)
sample(1:10)
set.seed(123)
sample(1:10)
```

A different seed

```{r}
set.seed(1)
sample(1:10)
set.seed(1)
sample(1:10)
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

### Drawing samples from a normal distribution {-}

The last function we are going to see is `rnorm`, that draws a random
sample from a normal distribution. Two normal distributions of means 0
and 100 and standard deviations 1 and 5, noted noted *N(0, 1)* and
*N(100, 5)*, are shown below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "Two normal distributions: *N(0, 1)* on the left and *N(100, 5)* on the right."}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(density(rnorm(1000)), main = "", sub = "N(0, 1)")
plot(density(rnorm(1000, 100, 5)), main = "", sub = "N(100, 5)")
```

The three arguments, `n`, `mean` and `sd`, define the size of the
sample, and the parameters of the normal distribution, i.e the mean
and its standard deviation. The defaults of the latter are 0 and 1.


```{r}
rnorm(5)
rnorm(5, 2, 2)
rnorm(5, 100, 5)
```

Now that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R's
data structures, we are ready to start working with larger data, and
learn about data frames.

## Additional exercises


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
- Create two vectors `x` and `y` containing the numbers 1 to 10 and 10
  to 1 respectively. You can use the `seq` or `:` functions rather
  than constructing them by hand.
- Check their type. Depending how they were created, they can be
  integers or doubles.
- Take the sum (see the `sum()` function) of each vector and verify
  they are identical.
- Sum vectors element-wise, and verify that all results are identical.
- Swap the value or `x` and `y`.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Calculate the mean of a random distribution *N(15, 1)* of size 100
  and store it in variable `m1`.
- Calculate the mean of a random distribution *N(0, 1)* of size 100
  and store it in variable `m2`.
- Calculate the mean of another random distribution *N(15, 1)* of size
  1000 and store it in variable `m3`.
- Can you guess with one of `m1` and `m2` will be larger? Verify in R.
- Can you guess with one of `m1` and `m3` will be larger? Verify in R.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

- Using the `sample` function, simulate a set of 100 students voting
  (randomly) for 1, 2 or 3 breaks during the WSBIM1207 course.

- Display the values as  a table of votes.

- Compute the number of students that wanted more that 1 break.

- Bonus: as above, but setting the probability for votes to 1/5, 2/5
  and 2/5 respectively. Read `?sample` to find out how to do that.
