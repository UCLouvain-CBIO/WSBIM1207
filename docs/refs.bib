   abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get
                  it ready for analysis, but there has been little
                  research on how to make data cleaning as easy and
                  effective as possible. This paper tackles a small,
                  but important, component of data cleaning: data
                  tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model
                  and visualize, and have a specific structure: each
                  variable is a column, each observation is a row, and
                  each type of observational unit is a table. This
                  framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets
                  because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
                  with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This
                  structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools
                  for data analysis, tools that both input and output
                  tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data
                  structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a
                  case study free from mundane data manipulation
                  chores.},

                  important part of the scientific process. Making
                  your data publicly available allows original results
                  to be reproduced and new analyses to be
                  conducted. While sharing your data is the first step
                  in allowing reuse, it is also important that the
                  data be easy to understand and use. We describe nine
                  simple ways to make it easy to reuse the data that
                  you share and also make it easier to work with it
